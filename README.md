DataStructureApp

Data Structure Lab Project

CookBook application helps the user to store their recipes by grouping the types like Starter, Main Meal, and Dessert in one place. Also, it gives recommendations to the users who are undecided about evening meals or open to the new dessert options. While creating this app, we used two data structures: Linked List and Binary Search Tree. Mainly, there are three types of the recipe all types are stored in the independent trees and liked recipes are stored in the linked list.
